## Regarding failed_prototype.c
This snippet of code is not used in the currently working version of the code.
However, it is referenced within our project 1 report, and is highly indicative
of the higher level organizations that we had planned. Though our current code
only successfully handles one pipe or redirect at the time, we believe that 
(had we figured out the exact technicality) this would allow us to use multiple
pipes and redirects within one larger set of commands.
